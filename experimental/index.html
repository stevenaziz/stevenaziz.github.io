        <header>Hey there,<br>Steven here.</header>
        <p>
            I'm an immensely-curious and obsessively-detailed computer science undergraduate student at Seattle Pacific University.<br><br>
            Currently, I'm in the senior year of my program and I expect to graduate in the Spring of 2024. 
            After graduating with my degree in computer science I will continue my education in graduate school to obtain a Masters in my field. 
            Throughout my rigorous education (especially during High School where I graduated with an International Baccalaureate "IB" Diploma, 
            the most prestigious high school diploma recognized in over 100 countries around the world) 
            I've also worked many different roles to gain work experience and valuable team skills.<br><br>
            As an up-and-coming software engineer I am seeking roles in software development to gain experience in my field and learn as much as possible from industry experts. 
            I am incredibly excited to graduate university and begin my career — I am confident my unique skillset will bring tremendous value to my next team!

                    The Graduation Planning App (GPA) is an exciting new application designed to simplify academic planning and optimize the journey of students at SPU. 
                    GPA knows about SPU’s course offerings and stores each student’s graduation requirements to automatically suggest a plan for how to take the required courses to graduate. 
                    GPA is highly personalized because it can craft an academic path suited for a particular student based on their preferences. 
                    By automating and refining academic advising, GPA will free up valuable advisor time, increase scheduling accuracy, and enhance student satisfaction at SPU.

                    Using <b>C++</b>, implemented a postfix expression simplifier that reads in an algebraic expression written in postfix 
                    and turns it into a binary expression tree. The simplifier recognizes both numbers and variables, and can perform basic operations 
                    such as + (addition), - (subtraction), and *(multiplication).

                    Using <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js</b>, my group implemented both front-end and back-end components of a simple list web app that has
                    the ability to add data to a simulated database via a JSON file, remove data from the database, and load the data each time the page 
                    loads. The Node.js module Express was used to support the backend.
